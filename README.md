# Portfolio Theory 

This project allows for a simple UI to search and add S&P 500 stocks to a portfolio. 
Once stocks have been added the minimum variance portfolio, or the optimal risky portfolio can be calculated. 
A check box indicating if short sales are allowed can be ticked. Stocks can be added or deleted from the portfolio. 
There is also an option to select a random portfolio by clicking the suitable button.
